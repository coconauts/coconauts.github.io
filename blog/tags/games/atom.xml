<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week we implemented <a href="/projects/404games">gamified 404 pages</a> into
coconauts. Everytime you hit a 404, instead of getting a boring
image and cursing for your misfortune, you&rsquo;ll now get a classic videogame
to make you forget your disappointment.</p>

<p>We initially implemented pacman and space-invaders style games, but
we&rsquo;ve now added a snake game on top of them, and not only that, the
source code for them is now public on
<a href="https://github.com/coconauts/404-games">a github repo</a>, so you can
use them in your own website if you want.</p>

<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This project has been available for a long time as a opensource software in <a href="https://github.com/coconauts/game-manager">github</a>,
but we didn&rsquo;t do any official announcement or anything as we have been testing it and adding
more features.</p>

<p>Today we present a software for managing all your games and emulators in your computer.</p>

<p><img src="http://coconauts.github.io/projects/game-manager/sim-city.png" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>In the past we tried with software like XMBC Game collection,
but it takes ages to download all the covers and info from the games.
We also tried <a href="http://malafe.net/">MALA</a> a <a href="/projects/game-manager/old-arcade.png">long time ago</a>,
and it was great, but a bit old and only available on Windows.
So we decided to build one in Node.js with a lot of features that we wanted.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Multiplatform lightweight app built in node.js and sqlite</li>
<li>Immediately list all your games without indexing or downloading anything</li>
<li>Mark games as &ldquo;In progress&rdquo;, &ldquo;Finished&rdquo; or &ldquo;Favorite&rdquo; for faster access</li>
<li>Search by name</li>
<li>Support keyboard controls</li>
<li>Download info from the games in real time from <a href="http://thegamesdb.net/">thegamesdb.net</a></li>
<li>Read covers and screens from disk</li>
<li>Automatically download missing covers from Google</li>
<li>Execute games from the app directly (you just need to set the exec argument)</li>
<li>Works with everything (even MAME games, windows or scummvm )</li>
<li>Open source</li>
<li>Compact and simple design</li>
<li>Record your gameplays</li>
</ul>


<h2>Demo</h2>

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ThvGbx2ku4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h2>How to run</h2>

<p>You have the full documentation in the <a href="https://github.com/coconauts/game-manager">repo</a>.</p>

<p>But as it&rsquo;s a Node.js application, as soon as you have node already installed in your machine
you only need to do:</p>

<pre><code>npm install &amp;&amp; node app.js
</code></pre>

<p>Once it&rsquo;s running, open a browser <code>localhost:8888</code> and start adding your platforms</p>

<h2>Future plans</h2>

<p>This application was the first thing we built in Node.js,
so the code can be improved as we have leart a lot about this language in the last few months.</p>

<p>The platform is quite useful and stable, but we can still work on new features like
customizable skins, online storage for gamestates, or even online gameplay so you can run your Game manager server
but play anywhere just like Sony or Steam do.</p>

<p>Just let us know what&rsquo;s your favorite feature and we will focus on that!</p>

<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Getting a <a href="http://coconauts.net/404">404</a> page is not something enjoyable,
that&rsquo;s why we wanted to build something nice for anyone that lands in this
unexpected place.</p>

<p>So we built a few simple classic games in HTML5 + Canvas, and you will get randomly
one of these everytime you land in our <a href="http://coconauts.net/404">404</a> page.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>All our 404 games will be published in our <a href="/projects/404games">project page</a></p>

<h2>Space invaders</h2>

<p><img src="http://coconauts.github.io/projects/404games/space-invaders.png" class="screenshot" /></p>

<p><a href="http://coconauts.net/html5/space-invaders">Test me</a></p>

<h2>Pacman</h2>

<p><img src="http://coconauts.github.io/projects/404games/pacman.png" class="screenshot" /></p>

<p><a href="http://coconauts.net/html5/pacman">Test me</a></p>

<p>Fortunately, 404 pages don&rsquo;t happen too often in <a href="http://coconauts.net">Coconauts</a>,
but still, this is an improvement over the previous version,
and we had fun building this.</p>
