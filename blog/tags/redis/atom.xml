<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CIs are good, as soon as your projects grow, having a continuous integration software
that manages all your apps and deployments is really useful. We have been using a self-hosted
jenkins instance in our server for a few years already, and we have some
<a href="/blog/2014/09/09/background-tasks-in-jenkins-ipchange">interesting things with it</a>.</p>

<p>However, we have always known that jenkins is too heavy, it consumes too much memory and it
has a slow interface, as it is written on Java.</p>

<p>So we were really looking for a lightweight self-hosted CI that could run easily on a Raspberry PI,
but we couldn&rsquo;t find any existing solution, so we decided to build our own, and it was easier that we expected.</p>
