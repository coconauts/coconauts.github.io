<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Arduino is an awesome platform, that allows you to create almost
everything you can imagine with a really tiny investment and some
basic hardware knowledge.</p>

<p>Everyone starts using Arduino UNO for development, and we see
<em>a lot</em> of projects using this board, but there are a few good
reasons why you shouldn&rsquo;t use UNO&hellip;</p>

<h2>Arduino UNO is expensive</h2>

<p>Arduino UNO is one of the most expensive boards that features the
ATMega328 compared with other Arduino models like Mini, Micro,
or Lilypad. There are
<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products">tons of them to choose from</a>)!</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th> Model       </th>
<th> Price (on store.arduino.cc) </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> UNO         </td>
<td> 20€</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> Micro       </td>
<td> 18€</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> Mini        </td>
<td> 14€</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> Lillypad    </td>
<td> 16€</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Note that these prices come from the
<a href="http://store.arduino.cc">oficial Arduino store</a>. However you can
easily find compatible clonic boards on Amazon, Ebay or Aliexpress,
at a fraction of the price.</p>

<p>You could also use a bare ATMega328 like we did in our
<a href="https://www.coconauts.net/projects/watchduino/">first Watchduino</a>
or in our
<a href="https://www.coconauts.net/blog/2014/10/18/arduino-radio-improvements-low-consumption/">light sensor with RF24 radio module</a>.</p>

<h2>Arduino UNO is big</h2>

<p>Arduino UNO is a big board, and you probably going to use a bread board
next to it, which makes your whole development prototype really complex.</p>

<p>Instead of that, use a Nano or Micro attached to a bread board directly.</p>

<p><img src="http://coconauts.net/images/posts/why-not-uno/uno_vs_nano.jpeg" /></p>

<h2>Arduino UNO is not power-efficient</h2>

<p>Most of the projects built with Arduino will be wireless and
battery-powered, so the device should be power-efficient,
but Arduino UNO is not.</p>

<p>Because Arduino UNO has a lot of hardware you don&rsquo;t need, it consumes
<em>a lot</em> more than its brothers:</p>

<ul>
<li>USB controller</li>
<li>Too many leds</li>
</ul>


<p>However, boards like Lilypad or Mini don&rsquo;t have a USB controller,
which reduces its normal consumption a few mAh, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standalone consumption for UNO: 28mAh</li>
<li>Standalone consumption for Mini: 13mAh</li>
</ul>


<p>This measures have been taken when running a dummy sketch
that does nothing (not even blinking a LED). If you make
heavier computations or put the Arduino to sleep, measurements
will vary.</p>

<h2>Arduino UNO uses USB-B connector</h2>

<p>Seriously?? in this day and age?</p>

<h2>Arduino UNO is not designed for production</h2>

<p>Because it&rsquo;s big, and has a very high consumption, you shouldn&rsquo;t
ever use it in a prototype, like a remote controlled device, or a
batery-powered-sensor, or a
 <a href="https://www.coconauts.net/projects/watchduino2/">smartwatch</a>.</p>

<p>Also, you probably don&rsquo;t want to develop in a hardware that won&rsquo;t
match the final product specs, do you ?</p>

<h2>Conclussions</h2>

<p>The only reason why you could want to use UNO is to use a shield,
but in most of the cases they&rsquo;re not worth it.</p>

<p>Our personal preference is Arduino Mini: it&rsquo;s small, cheap and has
the lowest consumption in its family.</p>

<p>So do yourself a favor and use any of the other boards available
instead of using UNO again.</p>
