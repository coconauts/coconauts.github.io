<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another year went by, and this is the third that we find ourselves writing
a retrospective in the blog, not bad eh?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z04M6NhkIKk">2016 hasn&rsquo;t been too cheerful</a>
(at least not for fans of the many stars that have left us this year,
or for people with progressive political views in general).</p>

<p>When it comes to Coconauts however it didn&rsquo;t go too bad:</p>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps the biggest highlight of the year is the
<a href="http://retrophies.win/">Retrophies project</a>. Featured in
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12205560">HackerNews</a> and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/4voi81/retrophies_achievements_system_for_emulators/">Reddit</a>.
We started it as an experiment that turned out to be successful,
and we are still expanding it (for instance, the latest addition was a
<a href="http://coconauts.net/blog/2016/12/29/how-improve-nintendo/">multiplayer mario game using websockets</a>).</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve been experimenting with the ESP8266 chip, as a more versatile,
powerful and cheaper alternative to Arduino, and we started
<a href="http://coconauts.net/blog/2016/09/08/smartwatch-prototype-with-esp8266/http://coconauts.net/blog/2016/09/08/smartwatch-prototype-with-esp8266/">migrating Watchduino to the ESP8266</a>.</li>
<li>A small hack that also turned out to be a hit is the
<a href="http://coconauts.net/blog/2016/06/13/lightning-dodge-o-matic/">Lightning-dodge-O-matic</a>,
featured on <a href="http://hackaday.com/2016/06/22/cheating-at-video-games-arduino-edition/http://hackaday.com/2016/06/22/cheating-at-video-games-arduino-edition/">Hackaday</a>!</li>
<li>We published our <a href="http://coconauts.net/blog/2016/02/04/coconauts-ci-nodejs/">custom mini-CI system</a></li>
<li>We started the year working on a <a href="http://coconauts.net/blog/2016/01/30/starcraft-mobile-unity3d/http://coconauts.net/blog/2016/01/30/starcraft-mobile-unity3d/">mobile version of Starcraft</a> (which we shortly after stopped working on, but there&rsquo;s still a demo video).</li>
</ul>


<p>Our plans of focusing on game making haven&rsquo;t materialized as much as we would have liked.
We&rsquo;ve also continued blogging very little during the year; although, there is one
aspect where we have delivered: more frequent status updates about ongoing projects. Thanks to this,
we&rsquo;ve shown you some prototyes and smaller projects through the year despite not
having any big reveals.</p>

<p>So what are our best whishes for 2017? Pretty much the same as the year before:</p>

<ul>
<li>More games</li>
<li>More open source</li>
<li>More frequent blogging</li>
<li>More awesome</li>
</ul>


<p>See you in 2017, have a good one! =)</p>

<link href="http://coconauts.net/blog/2016/01/01/year-retrospective/"/>
<updated>2016-01-01T14:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>http://coconauts.net/blog/2016/01/01/year-retrospective</id>
<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Year 2015 has come to an end, and as it turns out we do have
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_two-wheeled_board">hoverboards</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZRFcGrrsyc">holograms/augmented reality</a>,
yet for some reason hip-kids insist in dressing as lumberjacks rather than
in futuristic clothing.</p>

<p>It feels just like yesterday when we were writing
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/2014/12/31/coconauts-2014-retrospective/">our retrospective post</a>
last year. Time does fly! So how did we fare this year in comparison?</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://coconauts.net/projects/watchduino2/">second version of Watchduino</a>
was an absolute smash. We managed to get a functional prototype with
Bluetooth connectivity, plus a phone companion app. It&rsquo;s starting to
look something like a real smartwatch, and it was awarded
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/2015/08/24/watchduino-2-is-semifinalist-on-the-2015-hackaday-prize/">semifinalist in the Hackaday Prize</a>.</li>
<li>Our second big release of the year, even if it was a bit last minute,
was the long promised open sourcing of
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/2015/12/31/gramola-release/">Gramola</a>,
a web-based music player.</li>
<li>Smaller projects, but let&rsquo;s not forget about:
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/2015/10/13/notification-listener-android-cordova/">a notification listener plugin for Cordova</a>,
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/2015/04/22/simple-automatic-watering-system-arduino/">an Arduino automated watering system</a>,
our <a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/2015/07/31/404-games/">404-games</a>.</li>
<li>Seems like we still aren&rsquo;t blogging as much as we should, as we have some
extra small projects that we didn&rsquo;t tell you about in the blog:
<a href="https://github.com/coconauts/image-to-json">an image-to-json</a> converter,
<a href="http://itch.io/jam/procjam/rate/43682">a generative game</a> made for the
<a href="http://www.procjam.com/">PROCJAM</a> game jam, and
<a href="https://github.com/coconauts/find-open">a webapp to find open restaurants near you</a>.</li>
<li>We didn&rsquo;t blog as much as we would have liked, but even so we brought
you a bunch of tutorials about
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/tags/arduino/">Arduino</a>,
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/tags/unity3d/">Unity3D</a>, or
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/tags/chiptune/">chiptune music</a>, among others.</li>
</ul>


<p>The year certainly felt as packed as the year before, so we definitely
want to keep the momentum going for 2016. Here&rsquo;s our immediate plans for
the year to come:</p>

<ul>
<li>We didn&rsquo;t do as much gamedev as we would have liked during 2015, so we
would like to finish a Unity3D game during the next year. Specially now that
<a href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/es/2015/08/26/unity-comes-to-linux-experimental-build-now-available/">Unity3D is available for Linux</a>,
there&rsquo;s no better time!</li>
<li>Once again, we want to aim to do more and better posting. 2015 saw
regular blog updates until october, but for this year we want to do
even better.</li>
<li>To help fatten our blog and Github account, we want to commit to talk
about our projects even while in an early stage. Instead of doing the
development of a game or project in the dark until it is polished enough to
show (as done with <a href="https://coconauts.net/projects/timebomb2/">Exploding Bunnies</a>
or <a href="https://coconauts.net/projects/gramola/">Gramola</a>)
we want to to show prototypes and betas as early as we
have them, and keep our development more open
(as we have done with <a href="https://coconauts.net/projects/watchduino2/">Watchduino2</a>).</li>
<li>Speaking of Watchduino2, we plan to continue it&rsquo;s development due to
popular demand, albeit perhaps at a slower pace than we did during 2015.</li>
</ul>


<p>Wishing a happy and exciting 2016 for all our followers!</p>
