<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Year 2015 has come to an end, and as it turns out we do have
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_two-wheeled_board">hoverboards</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZRFcGrrsyc">holograms/augmented reality</a>,
yet for some reason hip-kids insist in dressing as lumberjacks rather than
in futuristic clothing.</p>

<p>It feels just like yesterday when we were writing
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/2014/12/31/coconauts-2014-retrospective/">our retrospective post</a>
last year. Time does fly! So how did we fare this year in comparison?</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://coconauts.net/projects/watchduino2/">second version of Watchduino</a>
was an absolute smash. We managed to get a functional prototype with
Bluetooth connectivity, plus a phone companion app. It&rsquo;s starting to
look something like a real smartwatch, and it was awarded
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/2015/08/24/watchduino-2-is-semifinalist-on-the-2015-hackaday-prize/">semifinalist in the Hackaday Prize</a>.</li>
<li>Our second big release of the year, even if it was a bit last minute,
was the long promised open sourcing of
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/2015/12/31/gramola-release/">Gramola</a>,
a web-based music player.</li>
<li>Smaller projects, but let&rsquo;s not forget about:
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/2015/10/13/notification-listener-android-cordova/">a notification listener plugin for Cordova</a>,
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/2015/04/22/simple-automatic-watering-system-arduino/">an Arduino automated watering system</a>,
our <a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/2015/07/31/404-games/">404-games</a>.</li>
<li>Seems like we still aren&rsquo;t blogging as much as we should, as we have some
extra small projects that we didn&rsquo;t tell you about in the blog:
<a href="https://github.com/coconauts/image-to-json">an image-to-json</a> converter,
<a href="http://itch.io/jam/procjam/rate/43682">a generative game</a> made for the
<a href="http://www.procjam.com/">PROCJAM</a> game jam, and
<a href="https://github.com/coconauts/find-open">a webapp to find open restaurants near you</a>.</li>
<li>We didn&rsquo;t blog as much as we would have liked, but even so we brought
you a bunch of tutorials about
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/tags/arduino/">Arduino</a>,
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/tags/unity3d/">Unity3D</a>, or
<a href="https://coconauts.net/blog/tags/chiptune/">chiptune music</a>, among others.</li>
</ul>


<p>The year certainly felt as packed as the year before, so we definitely
want to keep the momentum going for 2016. Here&rsquo;s our immediate plans for
the year to come:</p>

<ul>
<li>We didn&rsquo;t do as much gamedev as we would have liked during 2015, so we
would like to finish a Unity3D game during the next year. Specially now that
<a href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/es/2015/08/26/unity-comes-to-linux-experimental-build-now-available/">Unity3D is available for Linux</a>,
there&rsquo;s no better time!</li>
<li>Once again, we want to aim to do more and better posting. 2015 saw
regular blog updates until october, but for this year we want to do
even better.</li>
<li>To help fatten our blog and Github account, we want to commit to talk
about our projects even while in an early stage. Instead of doing the
development of a game or project in the dark until it is polished enough to
show (as done with <a href="https://coconauts.net/projects/timebomb2/">Exploding Bunnies</a>
or <a href="https://coconauts.net/projects/gramola/">Gramola</a>)
we want to to show prototypes and betas as early as we
have them, and keep our development more open
(as we have done with <a href="https://coconauts.net/projects/watchduino2/">Watchduino2</a>).</li>
<li>Speaking of Watchduino2, we plan to continue it&rsquo;s development due to
popular demand, albeit perhaps at a slower pace than we did during 2015.</li>
</ul>


<p>Wishing a happy and exciting 2016 for all our followers!</p>
