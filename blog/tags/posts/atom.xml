<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago we were requested to add a list of featured posts to an index page in Octopress.
So we did a bit of research about how Octopress + Jekyll + Lyquid template internally works.
And we ended up with a nice solution that you can easily replicate in your own blog.</p>

<p>In this post we will show you how to add your own custom list of featured octopress posts like in <a href="http://coconauts.net#featured-posts">Coconauts</a></p>

<!--more-->


<p>The first thing you need to do is to add a new custom tag to your posts, we will call it <code>featured</code></p>

<h2>```</h2>

<p>layout: post
author: Javier Rengel
published: true</p>

<h2>featured: true</h2>

<p>```</p>

<p>Create a new template file called <code>featured_posts.html</code> inside your <code>source/_includes</code> folder,
with this content:</p>

<p>
```</p>

<div class="row">
   {% assign featured_count = '' %}
   {% for post in site.posts %}
       {% if post.featured and featured_count.size < 3 %}
          {% capture featured_count %}{{ featured_count }}*{% endcapture %}
           <div class="col-sm-4 col-lg-4 column featured-post">
              <a class='post-link' href="{{ root_url }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title | titlecase }}</a>
              <p>{{ post.content | strip_html | condense_spaces | truncate:300 }}</p>
           </div>
       {% endif %}
   {% endfor %}
</div>


<p>```
</p>

<p>Then you can list your three most recent featured posts in every page you want just by adding this code to your markdown or HTML file:</p>

<p>
<code>
{% include featured_posts.html %}
</code>
</p>

<p>Just remember to adapt your HTML code and your CSS to your needs (this one is based on <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a>).</p>
