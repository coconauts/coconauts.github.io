Last week we implemented [gamified 404 pages](/projects/404games) into
coconauts. Everytime you hit a 404, instead of getting a boring
image and cursing for your misfortune, you'll now get a classic videogame
to make you forget your disappointment.

We initially implemented pacman and space-invaders style games, but
we've now added a snake game on top of them, and not only that, the
source code for them is now public on
[a github repo](https://github.com/coconauts/404-games), so you can
use them in your own website if you want.

[Happy mislinking](http://coconauts.net/404).
