Getting a [404](http://coconauts.net/404) page is not something enjoyable,
that's why we wanted to build something nice for anyone that lands in this
unexpected place.

So we built a few simple classic games in HTML5 + Canvas, and you will get randomly
one of these everytime you land in our [404](http://coconauts.net/404) page.

All our 404 games will be published in our [project page](/projects/404games)

## Space invaders

## Pacman

Fortunately, 404 pages don't happen too often in [Coconauts](http://coconauts.net),
but still, this is an improvement over the previous version,
and we had fun building this.
