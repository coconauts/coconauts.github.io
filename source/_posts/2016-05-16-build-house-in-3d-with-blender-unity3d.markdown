We moved home a few months ago to a beautiful house in the country side in UK,
outside the expensive area of London, but close enough to commute daily.

As soon as we moved in, we built a simple version of our home in 3D on Blender
 to help us decorate. And it proved to be very useful.

But there is something else you can do with a 3D model of a house...

<!-- more -->

Once the 3D model was built, it's easy to integrate into Unity3D and build
a game on top of it, on this case, a FPS or more like a FPW: First Person Walker,
a FPS without shooting, not as fun as it sounds.

The game is also a good chance to try out VR, perfect to use with Google VR to feel
like you are at home.

We posted an image on Twitter a few months ago about our first prototype:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I finally created a First person game of my new home with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/unity3D?src=hash">#unity3D</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blender?src=hash">#blender</a> . Looks better than real life! <a href="https://t.co/JjSPPP1835">pic.twitter.com/JjSPPP1835</a></p>&mdash; Javi Rengel (@rephus) <a href="https://twitter.com/rephus/status/698998470280089600">February 14, 2016</a></blockquote>

And this is how our place looks after we bought all the furniture.

If you are interested, you can download the 3D model we made [here](TODO).

Or just try the game on a browser, feel at home.
